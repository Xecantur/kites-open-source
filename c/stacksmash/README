Aleph One's Classic Buffer Overflow
Code: Aleph One
Phrack Issue 49(I think)
**********************************************
Acidfrost's Tiny exploit compile script
Code: Acidfrost
[SYNTAX]: ./exploitcc code.c programname
Desc:	A Tiny compile script that passes necessary requirements to gcc in order to set the executable with stack permissions /
-fno-stack-protector -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=0 -z execstack, it also compiles both the exploitable version and a debug version(the exploitable version also has -g, /
the debug version is just -g), the debug version on normal machines should return with a stack smashing /
 detected message and then [0xSOMEADDRESSHERE] anyhow its not necessary for this particular exploit as its / 
 self contained however this feature allows you to find the address where your program returns which you can then /
use to help you find the address of your code or nopsled.

Instructions:

./exploitcc overflow1.c aleph

sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0 # for ubuntu other distros may have another stack protection method (Tested on Ubuntu 10.04/Ubuntu 10.10)

./aleph

the you get a shell note its not a root shell its just a regular shell however you can get a euid shell(Effective Root shell) if you do this

su
chown 0:0 aleph
chmod 4755 aleph
exit
./aleph
