kbot was useful sure but it had some flaws like for instance the code was messy
rbot is much much more stable and more clean that kbot is.
rbot has 8 commands they are as follows
!op: usage !op name or !op . to refer to yourself
!dop: usage !dop name or !dop . to refer to yourself
!hop: usage !hop name
!dhop: usage !dhop name
!help: displays list of commands
!log: usage !log sometext
!join: usage !join #chan
!leave: usage !leave #chan
!say: usage !say sometext
